- Deep Learning & Neural Networks
- Quantitative Finance & Time Series
- Algorithms & Performance-oriented code

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning — From Scratch
> Core ML algorithms implemented using NumPy and math-first principles.

- [Linear Regression — from scratch](https://github.com/Aliekhalj/linear-regression-from-scratch)
- [Neural Network (MNIST) — from scratch](https://github.com/Aliekhalj/mnist-nn-scratch)
- [K-Means Clustering — from scratch](https://github.com/Aliekhalj/kmeans-clustering-from-scratch)
<!-- add new ones here -->

---

## 📊 Quant & Financial ML
> Applying ML and statistical methods to financial time series.

- [Bitcoin Time Series + Indicators](https://github.com/Aliekhalj/bitcoin-linear-regression)
<!-- future projects live here -->

---

## 🔬 Experiments & Research-Style Projects
> Exploratory or research-driven projects with deeper analysis.

- _Coming soon_
<!-- this becomes dangerous later -->

---

## 🎮 Creative / Curiosity-Driven
> Math, visuals, simulations, and just-for-fun builds.

- [3D ASCII Donut (pygame)](https://github.com/Aliekhalj/3D-ASCII-DONUT)
<!-- fun but still smart -->

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Stack
